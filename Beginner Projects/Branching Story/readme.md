## project in progress ##

this is a beginner level project to showcase fundamentals
of programming through the python language.

they will be showcased by making a branching story with user input, functions, dictionaries and making+importing a module (using it to organize the functions for readability's sake).

(if/else statements were deliberately avoided in this exercise for the sake of learning to encourage thinking outside the box by implementing uncommon solutions to problems)

choices are stored in dictionaries along with a reference to the function containing different nodes in the story, this way they can be called easily from the main file in an orderly fashion.
